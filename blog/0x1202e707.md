## Guidance
```
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
```
## Frustration
Now and then I get frustrated. I get frustrated from doing just about anything. When I get frustrated, there is nobody to turn to. I feel sad and lonely.
I feel bored and have nothing to do to effectively get myself out of that frustration. 
## Waste
I have spent 88 hours on zombsroyale profile on in games alone. I don't know how much more time I had spent there. That is equivalent to 3 online courses,
take each one as 35 hours. I could have done much more things in my life if I just don't go to gaming. I wasted so much of my precious time.
## Desolation
But again, it seems I got into such a state whenever I feel bored. I need to find an escape. Then I hurt my feet yesterday from road running at night so
I can only stay home today. I am feeling quite frustrated over that matter. I mean, I want to be social but it's just different.
