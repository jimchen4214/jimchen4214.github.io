## Daffodils
```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
```

## Disclaimer

Most of the sites here are not legal. Actually I do not like them at all. However, they do exist. 

## Watching Movies

123Movies, GoMovies, GoStream, MeMovies or 123movieshub was a network of file streaming websites operating from Vietnam which allowed users to watch films for free. It was called the world's "most popular illegal site" before being shut down a few weeks later on foot of a criminal investigation by the Vietnamese authorities. As of February 2023, the network is still active via clone sites.

[A Game of Thrones on Chinese site](https://xiaoheimi.net/index.php/vod/play/id/1610/sid/1/nid/1.html)

Anyways, there are so much more Chinese free movie sites than other free movie sites, and you can go though it without paying. 

## Personal Profiles

You can find a stranger's address and phone number. Horrible, right?

On [Truthfinder](truthfinder.com), get an account and you can find almost everybody's information.

Let's try [Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9x0AN7BWHpCDHSm9NiJFJQ). He is a hacker and it is ok to find his information (I think)

## Face Search
Search somebody with a photo on PimEyes(pimeyes.com)

Works

Explanation: I searched with a random photo of myself and my photo on the web turned up.

Shoot a photo of a stranger on the street(maybe a person you have instant crush on), and you can find him/her profiles.

## [YouTube Download](https://y2down.cc/en/)

Sometimes don't work so search on Google.

## [Yumpu Free Ebook](https://www.yumpu.com/en)

You can also search on google and pretty much find every popular books.

## [Phishing](https://github.com/KasRoudra/PyPhisher)

Clone this directory and you can run a fake google login page where whatever the other person enters you get it on the terminal. Poor google login page, though. Basically you can like email phish other people but it's not that effective.

## Tutorials

While there is a limited numbers of tutorials on YouTube, and some of them have to be accessed with specific emails (like @berkeley.edu), theses videos are all over bilibili, so there is no excuse for not learning!

## Conclusion

I am a poor young student. I don't subscribe and I don't have bad intentions. These are mere experiences of wandering on the Internet.
