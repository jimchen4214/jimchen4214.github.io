I hate using the iPhone. I prefer [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), and Google. [Help poor children in Uganda!](https://www.vim.org/images/vim_drill_small.JPG)

On weekends I usually [go for long hikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I6kvtPRnwc). 

## Personal Belief

I am a [libertarian](https://www.lp.org/), and I believe in individual rights. 


## Childhood Life

I was born in March 2005 in Shanghai. I don't have a middle name. I grew up in [Huamu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Huamu+Residential+District,+Pudong,+Shanghai,+China,+201204/@31.2063292,121.5388722,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x35b2774f5aa7bceb:0x531b835d17f9b07a!8m2!3d31.20633!4d121.547627) (meaning flowers and trees in Chinese) in Pudong. I spent my childhood years playing in [Century Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Century+Park/@31.2145783,121.5476807,16z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1scentury+park+shanghai!3m6!1s0x35b27749ec10c7b9:0x481d13ffeb63e916!8m2!3d31.212134!4d121.543724!15sChVjZW50dXJ5IHBhcmsgc2hhbmdoYWlaFyIVY2VudHVyeSBwYXJrIHNoYW5naGFpkgESdG91cmlzdF9hdHRyYWN0aW9umgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJyZVRoMVRUSm5SUkFC4AEA!16zL20vMDdjX25n) and [Shanghai Science & Technology Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Science_and_Technology_Museum).

I used to live in [Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiang_Hi-Tech_Park) in Shanghai. 

## Social Life

I am eager to make new friends. However, I do not go out of my way to satisfy others.

## Subscriptions

I used to subscribe to [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), [Wix](http://wix.org/), [NetworkChuck](https://learn.networkchuck.com), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/). Now I don't subscribe to any websites. 

I am just a poor young student, and after eating meals, fruits, and drinking milk I don't always have money left. [Software is like sex: it's better when it's free](https://twitter.com/Linus__Torvalds/status/296333253571387392).

## Personal Websites

I used to [blog in WeChat](https://weixin.sogou.com/weixin?type=1&s_from=input&query=%E7%A7%AF%E6%9C%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%88%90%E9%95%BF%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C&ie=utf8&_sug_=n&_sug_type_=). However, since there are many restrictions in WeChat I decided to switch.

I made my [old personal website](https://jimchen4214.wixsite.com/website-1) using [Wix](http://wix.org/), an easy-to-use platform where you can build a website in minutes. However, [Wix](http://wix.org/) is very slow. As of February 2023, [my Wix website](https://jimchen4214.wixsite.com/website-1) is no longer in use.

Inspired by the [CS 188 course website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/), I decided to make this personal website.
